2. **Living Virtuously**:

   - **Courage**: Facing fears with strength.  
   - **Temperance**: Practicing moderation.  
   - **Justice**: Treating others fairly.

3. **Mindfullness and Perspective**
   It tries to introduce the practice of being fully aware of your thoughts, emotions, and actions in the present moment.

   It also encourages the ability to view situations from a broader, rational standpoint rather than being consumed by immediate emotions or judgments.

4. **Harmony with Nature**
   
  - Living in harmony means accepting the flow of events, both good and bad, as part of this larger order.

  - Stoics emphasize living in harmony not only with nature but also with others, fostering mutual support and cooperation.

  - Avoid excess and live in a way that aligns with your true needs and values, rather than societal pressures or superficial desires.

## **How Stoicism Handles Emotions**
1. **Emotions as Natural**:  
Feeling emotions like fear or sadness is human. Stoics aim to prevent impulsive reactions, not deny emotions.

2. **Transforming Perception**:  
Emotions arise from judgments. Reframe events (e.g., a challenge instead of failure) to change emotional responses.

3. **Moderation Over Suppression**:  
Healthy expression is encouraged (e.g., grief is natural but should not consume you). The goal is balance, not denial.

> *“It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.”*  
– **Epictetus**
