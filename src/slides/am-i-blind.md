In-group Bias: The tendency to favor one’s own group over others, impacting judgments about individuals from different groups.

## Overcoming Bias
- Biases thrive under time pressure. Pause before making judgments about people or situations.
- Learn to listen. Seeing others perspective can give you a comparison to notice your own distortion
- Regularly question your assumptions and reactions. Ask yourself: *"Why do I think this way? Is this based on evidence or stereotypes?"*
- Thinking you dont have a bias is a bias in itself. **Blind spot bias**. Trying to not have a bias is not reasonable, learning how to manage them is. 
- Take a **Implicit Association Test**. Measures attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report.
- Seek feedback – Ask others if they notice biases in your decisions.

## Conclusion
Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts that often lead to flawed perceptions, irrational decisions, and unintended consequences. Whether in law, medicine, business, or everyday life, these biases distort reality, reinforcing stereotypes, perpetuating inequalities, and causing costly mistakes.
