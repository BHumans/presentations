* **Mental Clarity:** It helps us to clear out any confusion that we have
* **Increase sense of control:** we have a better control of our life because we understand what is exactly happening
* **Enhanced Problem-Solving:** “Fifty percent of the cure is the diagnosis” In order to solve any issue we need a good understanding of the problem. 
* **Builds confidence:** A lot of the time we don’t trust ourselves or our intuition because we don't understand where it comes from. Doing introspection gives us understanding, which allows us to gain trust in us
* **We understand others:** As we understand ourselves better we can extrapolate the same understanding into others. At the end of the day we are all humans. 
* **Resilience to manipulation:** Manipulation involves the influence of another person in us. If we know exactly what we want, the influence of others becomes minimal.
