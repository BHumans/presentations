### Setting the stage
- Reflect on your feelings and goals. Be clear of what you want and how you feel
- Set the right time and space for the other person to listen
- Write it down, read it, reflect if that is what you want to say. Start over

<br />

>Before you speak ask yourself if what you are going to say is true, is kind, is necessary, is helpful. If the answer is no, maybe what you are about to say should be left unsaid.
