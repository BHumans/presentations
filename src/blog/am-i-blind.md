*How our biases prevent us from seeing reality*



## What is a bias?

> **Bias** is a disproportionate weight *in favor of* or *against* an idea or thing, usually in a way that is inaccurate, [closed-minded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mindedness), [prejudicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice), or unfair [1]

Basically is a distorted way of seeing the world. We as humans behave and react according to our perception and if this perception is distorted it can affect our emotional state and make us do wrong decisions. With this essay I want to explore the science behind it and how we can take better decions knowing that our perception doesnt necessarily mean that is reality.



### Impact

Lets get some specific examples on how it affects us in our daily life. 

* We are in anxious in a daily basis because we believe the world has gone mad, the news, the war, the injustice. Its a horrible world and I feel like I need to be in alert as in any moment my life will end. 
* When I go out into the world I feel ugly, fat and unwanted.  
* I dont take young people seriously because they dont know anything about life. 
* I don't want to go to africa because is just people starving.     



### What does the science says 

Cognitive biases are often a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing. Biases often work as rules of thumb that help you make sense of the world and reach decisions with relative speed. They simplify our decision making. **We sacrifice accuracy for speed.** 



### How biases form? 

**Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms pre-existing beliefs.

**Anchoring Bias:** Relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the anchor) when making decisions.

**Availability Heuristic:** Judging the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind, often influenced by recent exposure.

**Hindsight Bias:** The inclination to see events as having been predictable after they have already occurred.

**Dunning-Kruger Effect:** A cognitive bias wherein individuals with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.

**In-group Bias:** The tendency to favor one’s own group over others, impacting judgments about individuals from different groups.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even when it may not be the best decision moving forward.

**Self-serving Bias:** The habit of attributing positive events to one’s own character but attributing negative events to external factors.

**Optimism Bias:** The belief that one is less likely to experience negative events and more likely to experience positive events compared to others.

**Status Quo Bias:** A preference for the current state of affairs, where changes from that baseline are perceived as a loss.

**Framing Effect:** Drawing different conclusions based on how information is presented, such as wording or context.

**Overconfidence Bias:** Holding a false or inflated sense of confidence in one’s own answers, judgments, or abilities.



### How to fight againts them

- Biases thrive under time pressure. Pause before making judgments about people or situations.
- Learn to listen. Seeing others perspective can give you a comparison to notice your own distortion
- Regularly question your assumptions and reactions. Ask yourself: *"Why do I think this way? Is this based on evidence or stereotypes?"*
- Thinking you dont have a bias is a bias in itself. **Blind spot bias**. Trying to not have a bias is not reasonable, learning how to manage them is. 
- Take a **Implicit Association Test**. Measures attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report.
- Seek feedback – Ask others if they notice biases in your decisions.

### Real life examples

**1. Confirmation Bias in the Criminal Justice System**

- **Example:** Investigators sometimes focus on evidence that supports their initial suspect while ignoring contradictory information.
- **Case:** The wrongful conviction of **Steven Avery** (featured in *Making a Murderer*) involved law enforcement disregarding alternative suspects due to preexisting beliefs about his guilt.

### **2. Gender Bias in Hiring & Performance Evaluations**

- **Example:** Studies show that identical resumes with male names receive more callbacks than those with female names, especially in male-dominated fields like STEM.
- **Case:** A 2012 Yale study found that science faculty rated male applicants as more competent and hireable than female applicants with identical qualifications.

### **3. Racial Bias in Medicine**

- **Example:** Some doctors underestimate pain levels in Black patients due to false beliefs about biological differences (e.g., "Black people have thicker skin").
- **Impact:** A 2016 study (*PNAS*) found that medical students and residents held such biases, leading to inadequate pain treatment for Black patients.

### **4. Anchoring Bias in Financial Markets**

- **Example:** Investors may fixate on an initial stock price (e.g., IPO valuation) and make irrational decisions even when new data contradicts it.
- **Case:** During the **Dot-com Bubble**, many investors overvalued tech companies based on early hype rather than fundamentals, leading to massive losses.

### **5. Availability Bias in Risk Perception**

- **Example:** People overestimate the likelihood of dramatic but rare events (e.g., plane crashes) while underestimating common risks (e.g., car accidents).
- **Impact:** After 9/11, many Americans avoided flying and chose driving instead, leading to an increase in road fatalities despite air travel being statistically safer.

### **6. Halo Effect in Workplace Performance**

- **Example:** A single positive trait (e.g., attractiveness, charisma) can lead to inflated perceptions of overall competence.
- **Case:** CEOs with taller stature or deeper voices are often perceived as more capable, even when their performance doesn’t justify it.

### **7. Sunk Cost Fallacy in Business & Government**

- **Example:** Continuing failing projects due to prior investment rather than cutting losses.
- **Case:** The **Concorde Fallacy**—Britain and France kept funding the unprofitable Concorde jet because they had already spent billions, despite clear evidence it would never be economically viable.

### **8. Ingroup Bias in Politics & Social Movements**

- **Example:** People dismiss valid criticisms of their political party while harshly judging opponents for similar actions.
- **Impact:** Polarization in U.S. politics leads to flawed perceptions of facts—e.g., Republicans and Democrats interpreting the same economic data in opposite ways.

### **9. Automation Bias in Technology & Aviation**

- **Example:** Over-reliance on automated systems can lead to ignoring human judgment.
- **Case:** The **Boeing 737 Max crashes** were partly due to pilots trusting the flawed MCAS system despite warning signs.

### **10. Survivorship Bias in Entrepreneurship & Media**

- **Example:** Focusing only on successful startups (e.g., Apple, Tesla) while ignoring the vast majority that fail.
- **Impact:** Aspiring entrepreneurs underestimate risks, believing success is more common than it really is.



### Conclusion

Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts that often lead to flawed perceptions, irrational decisions, and unintended consequences. Whether in law, medicine, business, or everyday life, these biases distort reality, reinforcing stereotypes, perpetuating inequalities, and causing costly mistakes.

Being aware of biases is crucial because:

1. **Better Decision-Making** – Recognizing biases helps us question assumptions, weigh evidence objectively, and avoid costly errors in judgment.
2. **Fairer Systems** – In institutions like hiring, policing, and healthcare, bias awareness can reduce discrimination and promote equity.
3. **Stronger Relationships** – Understanding biases (like the *fundamental attribution error*) helps us empathize rather than misjudge others’ actions.
4. **Smarter Investments & Policies** – Avoiding *sunk cost fallacy* or *confirmation bias* leads to more rational financial and policy choices.
5. **Improved Innovation** – *Survivorship bias* makes us overlook failures; acknowledging them fosters realistic strategies.

Ultimately, bias awareness isn’t about eliminating intuition—it’s about refining it. By actively identifying and mitigating biases, we make wiser choices, create fairer societies, and see the world more clearly.
